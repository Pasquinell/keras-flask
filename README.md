# Image recognition with Keras and flask
The entire purpose of this repo is to have a code snippet in case I need to build a deep learning prediction server. You can find the tutorial ![here](https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html).
I am having an error with tensorflow. Please do not use this code, it's useless.
In order to activate the environment install miniconda3 in your machine and load the virtual environment using the dependencies described in the file environment.yml with this command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
